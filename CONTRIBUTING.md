# Contributions
The scope of this project means it's fairly easy for me to maintain and update by myself, so in that regard I do not require assistance.
However anyone is welcome to fork, submit an issue, put in a feature request, or submit their own branch for a PR.
Any issue reports and reproductions of bugs are appreciated.

For info, questions, or to say hi, please mail me at zerofuchssoftware@gmail.com
