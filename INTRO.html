<h1>Magic Launcher Paradigm: Introductory Document</h1>
<h2>Why this doc?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In building magic launcher and documenting the insights gained, there's been a significant growth in the sheer volume of text.</li>
    <li>This intro doc is a briefer summary of the technical key points and the "why" behind such aggressive simplicity.</li>
    <li>In general, the ML Paradigm is not a full slot-in replacement methodology for every scenario</li>
    <li>Instead, it asks you to ask the question "If it can be done simply, why have we complicated it?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Magic Launcher Paradigm: Summary</h2>
<h3>Core Philosophy</h3>
<p>The Magic Launcher Paradigm prioritizes simplicity, speed, and user autonomy in software design. It builds tools that do one thing well, launch instantly, and work everywhere without surveillance or bloat.</p>
<h3>The Core Defiance: Universal Agnosticism</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The true power of this paradigm lies not in this repository's specific Python implementation, but in its profound simplicity.</li>
    <li>The core design—a basic JSON file describing a command to execute—is entirely language and system-agnostic.</li>
    <li>This core functionality could be replicated on almost any system with a simple text parser and an execution primitive.</li>
    <li>You could write a launcher in a Bash script, or even in BASIC on a computer from the 1980s.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Three Pillars</h2>
<h3>Speed is Life, Bloat is Death</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Sub-second startup, <50MB RAM.</li>
    <li>Every feature must justify its performance cost.</li>
</ul>
<h3>OS-Free Thinking</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Same behavior across platforms (Raspberry Pi to gaming rig).</li>
    <li>No OS-specific dependencies; use file-based configs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Focused Functionality</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Solve one problem exceptionally.</li>
    <li>Resist feature creep; explainable in one sentence.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Standards</h2>
<h3>Minimum Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>640x480 display, 32MB RAM, Python 3.6+, minimal dependencies (stdlib preferred).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Visual Design:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>CGA/EGA-inspired colors, monospace fonts, fixed grids.</li>
    <li>No animations, support 16-color terminals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code Principles:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Simple, fast code (e.g., subprocess.run(path)) over clever abstractions.</li>
    <li>Fail gracefully, log quietly, prioritize keyboard navigation.</li>
</ul>

</pre>
<h2>Key Principles</h2>
<h3>Tools, Not Services:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Tools launch without accounts, internet, or updates.</li>
    <li>Services (e.g., AI, cloud) are chosen consciously, not forced.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Simplicity is Security:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Minimal code (~200 lines) reduces attack surfaces.</li>
    <li>Transparency (e.g., plain JSON) prevents hidden malice.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compose, Don’t Abstract:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use pipelines (mltool | mlother) over inheritance or frameworks.</li>
    <li>Copy-paste code to avoid coupling.</li>
</ul>
<h3>JSON as Interface (or any simple parseable list format really):</h3>
<ul>
    <li>shortcuts.json defines commands (e.g., {"1": {"path": "xterm"}}).</li>
    <li>Numbers as verbs (mlrun "1 | 2") enable simple automation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Avoid Metadata Metastasis:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Keep configs lean; no unnecessary fields (e.g., usage stats).</li>
    <li>Use filesystem or external tools for analytics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Duplication seems complex, coupling IS complex</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Adding fields to existing records is often considered easier than simply creating new records</li>
    <li>My experience is that this results in difficulties debugging, and makes automation fiddly</li>
    <li>A file based system for handling data allows portions of logic to be ported without affecting the core</li>
    <li>Therefore, ML based apps will prefer additional files (password.txt) loaded separately, to additional fiels {"password":"foo", "shortcuts": {"Nesting": "More"}}</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tools in the Ecosystem</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Magic Launcher:</strong> GUI for launching shortcuts visually.</li>
    <li><strong>MLMenu:</strong> Terminal fallback for SSH or minimal systems.</li>
    <li><strong>MLRun:</strong> Non-interactive workflow composition via number sequences.</li>
    <li><strong>Sequai:</strong> Translates intent to numbers for AI integration.</li>
    <li><strong>MLView:</strong> Image viewer using minimal PIL features to avoid bloat.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Case Studies</h2>
<h3>Terraform Critique: Replaces stateful complexity with stateless shell scripts.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Modern Games: Rejects 100GB, always-online bloat for executable-based launching.</li>
    <li>Microservices: Achieves true independence with text streams, not Kubernetes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Litmus Tests for Features</h2>
<p>Before adding anything, ask:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Works over SSH on a 56k modem?</li>
    <li>Runs on a 2005 computer?</li>
    <li>Useful as the only feature?</li>
    <li>Implementable in <100 lines?</li>
    <li>Will it work in 10 years?If any answer is "no," reconsider.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Promise</h2>
<p>Magic Launcher tools:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Start instantly.</li>
    <li>Work offline, everywhere.</li>
    <li>Respect your hardware and choices.</li>
    <li>Never phone home or require accounts.</li>
    <li>Just. Fucking. Work.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<p>In a world of bloated, surveillance-heavy software, Magic Launcher offers a return to tools that empower users. By staying simple, composable, and transparent, it enables workflows from local scripts to distributed systems without losing clarity or control.</p>
<p>"Click a button, run a thing. No accounts, no updates, no bullshit."</p>
<h2>Optional Reading</h2>
<p>This is just to provide insight into my perspective, and isn't directly relevant into Magic Launcher's usage.</p>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>Every extra step or stop to look around is extra cognitive overhead, every new messy way of organising an additional layer on top of complex enough systems on their own.</p>
<p>The goal is to make any action you can perform on your computer, or almost, something that can be translated into a click and saved for re-use.</p>
<p>You click, it goes. All else is to aid this objective, or it is cut.</p>
<p>I am not averse to quality of life, and as the roadmap should indicate I have clear ideas of what constitutes a reasonably comprehensive featureset for such a project.</p>
<p>But if it hits a point where I have to do more than click once on my task bar, type a few letters, and press enter, Magic Launcher has slipped from it's path.</p>
<h2>The Artistic Statement</h2>
<p>At this point, I can only consider the production of Magic Launcher, the manifesto, and even the extras to be a form of programmer art.</p>
<p>While DevOps isn't programming or art in the traditional sense, it's got both creative and logical demands.</p>
<p>Magic Launcher, is a philosophical scream. The code manifesto, is what came out after I got the yell out of my system.</p>
<p>The Magic Launcher Paradigm, as described, is what I hope becomes an example of making software in fun, making it simple, making it solve.</p>
<p>Because every success I've ever had, even when working in full software as a service, has lain in making it simple, and having fun while I'm making it.</p>
<p>Terraform is cool, but it is the antonym of fun. Ansible is awesome, but one misaligned YAML and you've got silent failures down the whole chain.</p>
<p>I've also been, my entire life, an avid and regular video gamer, and power user.</p>
<p>From either perspective, it's been... demoralising to watch the potential of a connected information world get squandered in subscription services and excess analytics.</p>
<p>I grew to love computers because they made magic happen on the screen, faster than I could even blink. When did that become a sign your app is insufficient?</p>
<p>Everyone proudly proclaims their "low" response times and "streamlined" 12MB landing pages, when the backing behind it is several hundred appliances strong and supported by a half broken brick.</p>
<p>I can't even embed some 2 minute Youtube videos in a static site without increasing the number of requests and bandwidth to load it by over a dozen times.</p>
<p>Online applications have the potential to bring the Star Trek computer experience to us.</p>
<p>But "computer, help me with this problem." has been replaced as the ideal with the idea that an application being free means <em>you are the product</em>.</p>
<p>This entire project is a scream.</p>
<p>But, by the very nature of it, rather than being destructive, I seek to express <em>frustration through utility</em>.</p>
<p>I hope that, considering the degree of frustration, the utility is equally significant.</p>
<p>If you have opened the repository and read this far, thank you. This much is enough, if it hasn't sparked an interest in the code presented.</p>
<p>If you are still interested, please:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Peruse this file, the FAQ, and the Changelog at your leisure to learn how Magic Launcher can be nifty for you.</li>
    <li>Take a look at the CODEMANIFESTO and ADDENDUMs in the DOCS folder for a deep dive into exactly what this is all about.</li>
    <li>Run Magic Launcher, add one or two of your favourite browser links, maybe try setting up a shortcut to open task manager or launch your IDE. Tell me how it works for you.</li>
    <li>Experiment, modify, or update any of the apps involved to your taste - they're fairly bite sized.</li>
</ul>
<p>And lastly, please:</p>
<p>Think of a small problem, focus on just that, and write a program to solve it.</p>
<p>It's easier than it sounds, and you know you've solved a real problem when running the fix makes a grin pop up.</p>
<p>Enjoy Magic Launcher!</p>
