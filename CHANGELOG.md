## Roadmap / Future Ideas

### Short Term
- Ctrl + N for new shortcut
- Ctrl + H to return to Home
- "Duplicate to..." function to copy shortcuts to other folders
- Alternative icon formats (ICO, PNG, JPG) (Use PIL to covert to bmp for simplicity)
- Portable mode putting .config in the working directory. (Check for empty file "portable", enable by creating the file)

### Medium Term
- Full screen (simple output scaling)
- Import .lnk, .desktop and .shortcut files from system
- Config Validator and import/export util
- Multiple launcher profiles
- Custom color schemes
- Default app association customisation by file extension
- Better handling of streaming output like tail -f
- Move away from constants, port into config

### Long Term
- Two modes: Admin/Unlocked and Locked/User. Admin by default unless proper private key is provided.
```
Visual indicators:

Red padlock icon in title bar when locked
Disabled + and edit buttons
Right-click menu only shows "Properties"
Maybe different title bar color

The key check could be:

Hash the key file contents
Compare to stored hash in ./config/launcher/key
If match, enable edit mode

e.g. python app.py --unlock ~/.ssh/admin_key
```
- Arrow key navigation
- Arrangement Editor
- Gamepad/controller support
- Touch screen support (virtual keyboard mostly, mouse actions covered as long as it's multitouch)
- Grid size scaling
- Neaten up widgets

### Super Maybe
- Recent items tracking
- Icon and font scaling

### Priority Reminder
- Any feature needing more than a hundred or two lines of code is probably too complicated for a single feature
- Bloat is the speed killer, bloat is the technical debt that leads to stagnation.
- Any feature which violates these two principles *will* be dropped.
